# habitrpg-redirect
Simple Node.js Express app to redirect requests to habitica.com.

Main Habitica repository: https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica

When what would become Habitica was first created, it was called HabitRPG, meaning Habit Role-Playing Game. As the app grew in scope and popularity, however, more and more users not familiar with the RPG genre started to use it, and found the abbreviation confusing. Cue the change to "Habitica", a name meant to evoke a fantasy land of better habits without reference to geeky initialisms.

This app helps us move on from the old name by running on habitrpg.com, but sending traffic to habitica.com. It's Node.js and Express because that's the technology we use on the main site!
